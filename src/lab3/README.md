# Lab 3: Word Embeddings and Similarity

## Overview
Lab 3 focuses on word embeddings using pre-trained models (GloVe) and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Key Contents
- **Gensim**: Load and use pre-trained GloVe embeddings, find similar words, and compute word similarity
- **Spark**: Train Word2Vec model with Spark MLlib
- **Visualization**: Reduce dimensionality using PCA and t-SNE, then visualize word relationships
