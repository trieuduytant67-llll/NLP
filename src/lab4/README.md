# Lab 4: Text Classification

## Overview
Lab 4 focuses on text classification using multiple approaches:
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Classifier

## Dataset
- Twitter Financial News Sentiment dataset from Hugging Face
- Classes: Negative (0), Neutral (1), Positive (2)

## Key Techniques
- Text preprocessing with NLTK and scikit-learn
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Multiple classification algorithms comparison
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy

## Files
- Main notebook: `../../notebook/lab4.ipynb`
- Report: `../../report/lab4.md`

## How to Run
See the notebook in `notebook/lab4.ipynb` for interactive execution.

## Key Results
- Baseline Logistic Regression achieved 77% accuracy
- TF-IDF representation proved highly effective for this dataset
